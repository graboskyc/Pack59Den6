# Hello, Bears!

This is the home page for Pack 59 Den 6 (Bears). This year our Den Leader is Chris.

Each Adventure below will have a Chris's Den Guide which is something I write to guide the Adventure together. You can see other similar ideas on the Scouting.org Adventure page for that Adventure. There may be other auxilary materials for each Adventure (videos, printable games, etc) that are also enumerated.  

# Requirements
This year we must complete **six** required Adventures and any **two** elective Adventures.

Required Adventures have a color icon on the belt loop while electives are a monochromatic muted blue.

You can see all Bear Adventures on the Cub Scouts website [here](https://www.scouting.org/programs/cub-scouts/adventures/bear/).
